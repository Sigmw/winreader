Winreader is a process memory reader and debugger for Windows, implemented and developed in the Rust language, using the official [Microsoft Rust API](https://crates.io/crates/winapi).

Winreader is able to return information such as: process path, memory address, buffer address and size of allocated memory
|            |             |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Process Path   | Memory Address         |
| Stack Value    | Allocated Memory (MiB) |
| Dependencies (DLLs, modules), that the process is using |

### Usage

All information you need to use winreader is the PID (Process Identifier) ​​of the program that will be read, you can use Windows Task Manager or PowerShell's tasklist command.
